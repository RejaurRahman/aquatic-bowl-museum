    animalDescription: '<span class="highlighted-text">Also known as the paiche or the pirarucu, the arapaima is an air-breathing fish that plies the rain forest rivers of South Americas Amazon Basin and nearby lakes and swamps. One of the worlds largest freshwater fish, these giants can reach 9 feet (2.75 meters) long and weigh up to 440 pounds (200 kilograms). They have a wide, scaly, gray body and a tapered head. Though arapaimas can stay underwater for 10 to 20 minutes, they tend to remain near the waters surface, where they hunt and emerge often to breathe with a distinctive coughing noise. They survive mainly on fish but are known to occasionally grab birds close to the waters surface.</span> <span>The arapaimas proximity to the waters surface make it vulnerable to human predators, who can easily target them with harpoons. Some indigenous communities consume the arapaimas meat and tongue and collect its large scales, which are fashioned into jewelry and other items. The Amazons seasonal floods have become part of the arapaimas reproductive cycle. During low-water months (February to April) arapaimas construct bottom nests and females lay eggs. Young begin to hatch as rising water levels provide them with flood conditions in which to flourish. Adult males play an unusual reproductive role by incubating tens of thousands of eggs in their mouths, guarding them aggressively and moving them when necessary.</span> <span>While this giant fishs habitat is relatively unmolested, overfishing has become a serious problem, and some South American authorities have attempted to enact protections.</span>',

When hooked, the tarpon leaps vigorously, which makes it a sought-after game fish. They have silvery bodies covered with large scales. Adult tarpons prey on crabs, shrimp and fish, and swallow them whole. The tarpon can breathe with its swim bladder (which, in most other fish, is only there for buoyancy). Being able to rise to the surface and gulp oxygen not only gives them short bursts of energy, but enables the young and adults alike to survive in waters where oxygen is low and there are fewer predators.</span> <span>Tarpons can tolerate a range of salt levels and temperatures. However, temperatures below 60° Fahrenheit (15.5 Celsius) make them inactive, and below 40° Fahrenheit (4.4 Celsius) are fatal. They pick warm and secluded areas to spawn. The sperm and the eggs are all released into the water — this is called “broadcast” spawning. Females release up to twelve million eggs at a time. Once fertilized, the eggs float on the water — this is the leptocephalus stage — looking like transparent ribbons, which makes them difficult for predators to spot. For nourishment, they absorb nutrients from the water through their skin. The tarpon then goes through the juvenile stage, remaining in shallow waters, and then finally becomes an adult.</span>',

Their dinosaur-like bodies match their prehistoric lineage. They are covered with strong bony plates; they have asymmetrical, shark-like tails; and they have barbels off of their long snouts that help in locating their prey. Combined with their extremely large size, the look of the beluga sturgeon can be quite intimidating, but this species is harmless and actively avoids people.</span> <span>The beluga sturgeon is one of the only species of sturgeons that actively eats other fishes and is one of the largest predatory fishes on Earth. Adult beluga sturgeon have few natural predators, but fishing pressure by people has been very high. The beluga sturgeon is, unfortunately, cursed with producing some of the most desirable caviar in the world. Caviar is the table name for fish eggs, and beluga sturgeon produce millions of eggs. Large individuals have been known to carry several hundred pounds of caviar, and beluga sturgeon caviar can be worth as much as US$3500/pound (US$8000/kilo). This incredible value combined with the amount of eggs that a single beluga sturgeon can produce makes this species the most valuable fish in the world to fishers. That value may be the beluga sturgeon’s doom. When preparing to spawn upriver, the beluga sturgeon is easy to capture, by harpoon or in nets. Even though it has been given limited legal protection in many areas, its numbers are decreasing everywhere that it lives. It is completely gone from several seas/rivers in which it used to live, and scientists fear that it is critically endangered. In other words, it is very highly vulnerable to extinction across its entire range. Without further protection and enforcement of existing efforts, we may forever lose one of the biggest, most interesting fishes in the world.</span>',

It prefers warm, shallow coastal waters and estuaries as opposed to the deep open ocean. It is small to average-sized with a short, bluntly rounded snout and horizontally oval eyes. It is dark grey in colour with black marks on the ends of all fins. This species reaches maturity at about four to five years of age and often live longer than 10 years. The shark usually gives birth to four to six pups in each litter, and the Galapagos Marine Reserve provides important sites for their pupping grounds. Fish make up 90% of their diet, but they will also feed on rays, skates and smaller sharks.</span> <span></span> <span>Blacktip sharks are sometimes spotted above the water. They leap above the surface, rotate several times, and splash down on their backs. This dramatic display is sometimes part of a stealthy feeding method they use to strike at schools of bony fishes near the water surface. The sharks hurl themselves at the fish from below. Blacktip sharks supplement their diets with skates, stingrays, squids, and some crustaceans. These sharks have also been known to follow fishing boats and feed on discarded bycatch.</span> <span>In 2008 DNA evidence confirmed that a female shark fertilized her own egg, impregnating herself without the help of a male. Its not entirely known how rare this event, called parthenogenesis, is among blacktip or other sharks. During more conventional breeding blacktips offer scientists a fine opportunity for observation. The sharks gather in aggregations to set up pup nurseries in shallow, near-shore waters. Female blacktip sharks produce four to ten live, free swimming pups per litter. They begin to reproduce at age four or five and continue to do so every other year throughout their lives, which can last longer than a decade. Young blacktips live in the coastal nurseries as juveniles, which likely helps them avoid predation from larger sharks.</span>',

They are also extremely curious and often approach people to investigate.  Their intelligence is likely both a result of and a driver of their complex social structures.  They generally live in small groups and organize complex, group behaviors when mating and hunting.  Their preferred prey includes small, schooling fishes and squids.  Adult common bottlenose dolphins have no known predators, and juveniles are likely only rarely taken by large sharks or perhaps other predatory marine mammals.</span> <span>This species is hunted for human consumption and for use as fishing bait in several places around the world, but global numbers are generally considered to be in good shape.

    animalDescription: '<span class="highlighted-text">Reaching lengths of 11 feet (3.5 m) and weights up to nearly 700 pounds (315 kg), the bull shark is one of the largest requiem sharks (Family Carcharhinide). They are aggressive predators and eat a variety of prey. They are known to eat several species of bony fishes and also small sharks, some mammals (both terrestrial and marine), seabirds, and occasionally sea turtles. Large, adult bull sharks do not have any natural predators. Bull sharks do not mature until they are 15 or 20 years old. They mate via internal fertilization and give birth to well-developed, live young. Though they give live birth, bull sharks do not connect to their young through a placenta. Instead, during the gestation period, the embryos survive off of yolk sacs attached to each individual.</span> <span>Bull sharks do not just venture into freshwater for short periods. They travel far upriver in some places (including the Nicaragua River, the Zambezi River, and the Mississippi River) and there is a semi-permanent population in Lake Nicaragua that was thought until recently to be a separate species. They also apparently give birth in freshwater. During these long periods inland, bull sharks come into close contact with people, and most of the incidents when they have bitten people have been in rivers rather than in the ocean. Even so, these events are extremely rare. Typically, when a bull shark does bite a person, it only takes one exploratory bite and quickly realizes that the person is not its preferred prey. Unfortunately due to their size, even an exploratory bite can be fatal or extremely traumatic.</span> <span>Bull sharks have been fished, commercially, in the past, but currently the biggest threat that they face is accidental capture in fisheries targeting other species. Most of these accidental captures take place when these sharks are upriver. They are also occasionally targeted in shark culling operations meant to promote the safety of beachgoers and other tourists. This activity has not been proven to be effective in protecting swimmers and is generally frowned upon by conservationists and scientists. As a result of the risks that bull sharks face throughout their range, the species is considered near threatened with extinction. If population trends are not reversed, this species may be at greater risk.</span>',

They are one of the most colorful and intricately patterned families of saltwater fish, and aesthetic beauty is one of the top reasons people keep fish. They range from 12 to 22cm (4.7 to 8.7 inches) in length; however some species such as the Saddle Butterflyfish can grow up to 30cm (12 inches). Butterflyfish are diurnal animals, which means they are active and feed during the day and rest on the coral during the night. They mostly eat plankton, coral and sea anemones. The smaller species tend to stay in groups, whereas the larger species are usually solitary or swim with their mating partner, with whom they mate for life.</span> <span>Butterflyfish are some of the more brightly and striking patterned fish in the sea, perhaps this is why they are so popular to aquarists. Whilst the majority of species have vivid patterns in whites, blues, reds, oranges, yellows and blacks, some species are duller in color, yet still with intricate patterns. Many butterflyfish have dark bands across their eyes, and round dots on their flanks which can be confused with eyes to predators. This confuses the predators as to which way the fish is likely to flee. They have thin, flattened, disk-shaped bodies, with an uninterrupted dorsal fin. Most species have elongated noses which allow them to reach small crevices to feed. They closely resemble the Angelfish, however they don’t have elongated noses, they are a lot bigger, and they don’t have the preopercle spines at the gill covers. Butterflyfish fry (the babies) develop armored plates which protect them from predators when they are so vulnerable. These plates disappear as they reach maturity.</span> <span>The behavior and compatibilities of the Butterflyfish depends on the species, you should read the species section below for a more detailed look on individual species. For now, we’ll just take a general look at their behaviors. Butterflyfish generally stay in groups unless they are a particularly territorial species. A solitary Butterflyfish is usually travelling in search of a mate. They are one of the very few fish who find a mate, and then hunt, live and travel together for life. Butterflyfish are extremely good swimmers, the constant strokes made by their pectoral fins allow them to move quickly and swiftly. Due to their small size, they are able to hide themselves into crevices which, as well as being beneficial for getting food, lets them hide from predators. Most Butterflyfish are shy and will be fine in a tank with other peaceful tank mates as long as the tank is large enough and there are plenty of hiding spaces. Some species, in particular the obligate coral feeders, are more territorial and prone to attacking if other species come into their zone. The more territorial fish are usually fine in pairs or small groups of the same species, but mixing them with other Butterflyfish should generally be avoided. Ideal tank-makes for Butterflyfish include Clownfish, Damsels, Gobies, Hogfish, Parrotfish and Tangs.</span>',

    animalDescription: '<span class="highlighted-text">Adult Chinook salmon live in coastal seas and feed on pelagic invertebrates and other fishes. During the oceanic portion of their life cycle, these fish are primarily concerned with growing and storing energy that they will require for successful reproduction. This period can last anywhere between one and eight years. Once they reach reproductive size, they begin a long migration to their preferred spawning ground, fair inland, in freshwater rivers. In some rivers, the preferred spawning areas can be as far as 1900 miles (3000 km) upriver and at elevations of 5000 feet (1500 m) above sea level. Interestingly, though they mix into large populations at sea, each individual Chinook salmon returns to spawn in the river where it hatched. Thousands of individuals migrate to and reach the spawning grounds at the same time. Once they arrive, females dig nests in light gravel and lay their eggs on the river bottom. Males fertilize the eggs externally, and then the females bury the nests. Chinook salmon do not feed during the long trip to spawn, and the difficult task of swimming upriver, jumping up rapids and waterfalls, and digging nests is too much to survive. As soon as they spawn, individuals of this species die. After they hatch, baby Chinook salmon slowly make their way to the ocean, where they feed until they reach maturity and begin the cycle again.</span> <span>Chinook salmon are important oceanic prey for species such as the steller sea lion and the killer whale. They are also an extremely important source of nutrients and food for species that live near their spawning grounds (where they all die). Those species include bears, predatory and scavenging birds, wolves, and countless other species. In fact, even trees growing along north Pacific rivers likely rely on dead Chinook salmon and other salmons for vital nutrients required for growth. The Chinook salmon is also an important fishery species. In the ocean, large boats target this species in very large numbers. While they migrate toward their spawning grounds, Chinook salmon are targeted by smaller-scale operations of fishers – many from native peoples that have relied on Chinook salmon runs for thousands of years. Unfortunately, overfishing, climate change, and damming of large, coastal rivers all threaten Chinook salmon, and several populations are critically endangered (very highly vulnerable to extinction) or even extinct. Dams that prevent this species from reaching its preferred spawning grounds are probably the most detrimental human impact on Chinook salmon populations.</span> <span>Though they are native only to the north Pacific Ocean, Chinook salmon have been established, purposefully or accidentally, in several other places in the world – including New Zealand, Chile, and other places. Many of the established populations are a result of escapement from aquaculture facilities. The Chinook salmon is one of the most heavily aquacultured marine species and is the object of a very large market of farmed salmon.</span>',

They are plankton pickers, which means they visually seek and eat individual zooplankton or phytoplankton floating in the water column. They also likely eat algae from the reef surface. Because of the protection afforded them by their host anemones, common clownfish have few predators, but they are at risk of predation when they leave the anemone to feed.</span> <span>The common clownfish lifecycle is both interesting and rare. Like all clownfishes, this species changes sex throughout its lifetime. Sex change is not particularly rare, but most species change from female to male. The clownfishes change from male to female. All individuals hatch as males and eventually join groups of a few individuals living together in an anemone. The largest individual of each group is the only female, and she and the largest male are the only two that reproduce. The large, dominant female lays her eggs on the reef surface, and the male fertilizes them. Together, they guard the nest from egg predators until they hatch. If anything happens to the female, the reproductive male changes sex, becoming the dominant female. The next largest male then becomes reproductively active, and the other males in the group continue to be subordinate.</span> <span>The common clownfish is extremely popular in the aquarium trade. Some individuals are bright orange and white, while others are dark black and white. The stark colors and the relationship with anemones make this species highly desirable for public and private aquaria. They have long been collected for sale in that industry, but recent efforts to promote reproduction in captivity have been successful, so many of the individuals for sale in pet stores have been reared in aquaria. The conservation status of this species is currently unknown, but it has likely been depleted in some areas as a result of its collection for the pet trade. Fortunately, the continued development of a captive breeding program has reduced the pressure on wild populations.</span>',

Its body is dark blue with white and electric blue rings. Male emperor angelfish are territorial, and they will defend their living space, as well as the few females they share it with.

It is possible to keep other Angelfish with the Emperor, as long as they are not too similar visually. Always introduce a juvenile Emperor Angelfish as the last fish to the tank; this should prevent any territorial behavior. Small peaceful fish are likely to be harassed by this species. They get on well with most other large saltwater fish that are not similar in shape. You should also avoid any fish which are small enough for them to eat. This species may initially be shy when you first introduce them to the aquarium, but in general become a very active fish. You might also find that your Emperor Angelfish makes a grunting noise when it feels threatened.</span> <span>Depending on the age of the fish, you might find that they refuse food when they are first introduced. This is why an established tank is preferable – so they can find their own food whilst they acclimatize. In the first couple of weeks it is best to feed them little and often, up to 5 times per day. Emperor Angelfish are omnivores, meaning they eat both meat and plant matter; they will need a balanced diet of vegetable matter, meaty foods and sponge material. It is very difficult to replicate the diet they have in the wild, because they eat a wide variety of sponges, small organisms such as tunicates, hydroids and bryozoans, and small amounts of algae. To keep replenishing your tank with enough sponges would be difficult and expensive. Therefore you should feed your angelfish a diet of Spirulina, algae, plenty of live or frozen foods and formula foods. They will accept vegetable based foods and meaty foods such as chopped squid, scallop and shrimp. You might also want to make your own food at home to ensure they get the best possible diet. This can consist of mussels, shrimp, squid and spinach. Once they have acclimatized to tank life, you should feed your angelfish small amounts, two to three times a day. Remember to remove any food they haven’t eaten after 5 minutes to keep the water quality optimal.</span>',

    animalDescription: '<span class="highlighted-text">Aside from being the largest of all octopuses, the giant Pacific octopus is also recognizable by its typical reddish-pink color.  The octopus is equipped with special pigment cells, called chromatophores, just below the surface of the skin that allow it to change color and blend in with rocky or coral-laden surroundings. Octopuses are actually mollusks—their shells are located in the head as two small plates and the rest of their body is soft. Since they lack a protective outer shell, octopuses like the giant Pacific octopus, use their camouflage abilities to stay safe. When threatened, octopuses can also cloud predators in black ink.  The ink is toxic and can be deadly to octopuses if confined to a small space with little current flow. Giant Pacific octopuses spend most of their lives alone. They hunt at night for shrimp, clams, lobsters and fish, but have also been known to eat small sharks using their beak-like mouths to puncture prey.</span> <span>Along with eight arms, an octopus also has three hearts and nine brains. Two of the three hearts pump blood to the gills, while the third circulates blood to the rest of the body. Octopuses use one central brain to control their nervous systems and a small brain in each arm to control movement. Octopuses, including the giant Pacific octopus, are also known for having blue blood thanks to a copper-rich protein called hemocyanin in their bloodstream, which is efficient for oxygen transport in cold ocean environments.</span> <span>Giant Pacific octopuses only live an average four to five years in the wild, yet they are still considered one of the longest-living octopus species. Octopuses typically die shortly following breeding. After mating, a female will lay up to 74,000 eggs or more in a deep den or cave and live there for seven months watching over them. During this time, dedicated mothers won’t venture out for food, and shortly after the young hatch, the mother will die. Because of this behavior, it is difficult to know population numbers of the giant Pacific octopus. Even though these octopuses are still commercially fished in both North America and Japan for food and bait, populations have been naturally resilient so far.</span>',

    animalDescription: '<span class="highlighted-text">If you have ever had a goldfish of your own, they may not have lived very long. It has been reported, however, that the oldest goldfish to have ever lived was 45 years old. Most goldfish do not live this long, but some goldfish can live for a very long time. Another weird fact is that, if you want to tell how old a goldfish is, you just have to look at its scales. A goldfish grows a year on its scales for every year it lives, so, just like a tree, count the rings and you will know how old the fish is! When you think of goldfish perhaps you think of a bowl or a small tank with a few small goldfish swimming around. Goldfish don’t have to be small though, they can grow to over 30cm in length. Next time you are out somewhere where fish are able to swim in a bigger tank, or even in a pond outside, have a competition over who can find the biggest goldfish.</span> <span>If you thought it was a weird fact that fish have teeth in their throat, did you know that they don’t have stomachs? Our stomachs do two very important jobs, they help us to store food and they help us to break food down. Goldfish need to be fed little bits quite often because they don’t have anywhere to store the food to keep them going. This is also why they need to poop a lot, food really does go straight through them! Since goldfish do not have stomachs, it is very important to be careful when you are feeding them. Only feed them small amounts of food at a time, and make sure that it is the right kind of food for goldfish. Without a stomach to help them break food down, feeding goldfish the wrong thing can make them very sick.</span> <span>Humans are able to see primary colours (red, yellow and blue) and whatever colours you can make by mixing them together. Goldfish can see these colours and a fourth colour, ultraviolet (UV) light. UV light helps them see movement in the water. Goldfish need to be able to see this fourth light because they can’t see very far and, since their eyes are placed on either side of their head, they can’t see straight ahead like we can. Would you rather be able to see four colours, but not be able to look in front of you, or three colours like us? Here’s another interesting fact about goldfish, they have a memory of about three months, not three seconds. This means that they can learn things because they can remember things you are trying to teach them. If you have a goldfish at home, feed them at the same time every day and you will see that, at about the time you are going to feed them, they will start looking for food and will know that you are coming to feed them when they see you.</span>',

    animalDescription: '<span class="highlighted-text">The gray seal lives in North Atlantic waters and is divided into three distinct stocks—the North Atlantic stock, the Baltic Sea stock and the eastern North Atlantic stock. In these waters, gray seals experience cold temperatures and sub-arctic environments. Males will come ashore, including onto ice, to mate, often competing with each other for access to females. Females remain on land at pupping sites called rookeries to nurse newborn pups. These pups, which are born with stark white fur, look unrecognizable next to the parents but will quickly shed this fur for the mottled brown and silver fur that adults have. From birth to three weeks old, a gray seal pup may gain up to three pounds a day feeding on the mother’s nutrient-rich milk. A pup can survive off blubber reserves for several weeks as it waits to shed its lighter fur before going to sea and dispersing across large areas. Male gray seals can reach 10 feet long and more than 850 pounds, while females are slightly smaller at 7.5 feet long and 550 pounds.</span> <span>When not on land, adult gray seals visit the water to hunt for food, like fish, crustaceans, squid and octopus, gobbling up between four to six percent of their body weight every day. A gray seal can dive to depths of up to 230 feet on average to swallow fish and other creatures, or to bring larger food to the surface to break up in pieces for eating. A gray seal can hold its breath for more than an hour at a time. Groups of gray seals will sometimes engage in “social feeding,” in which several individuals work together to better prevent prey from swimming away. Gray seals can fall prey to killer whales and sharks as they rest on the water’s surface, keeping their head and neck above the water to breathe.</span>',

In some cases, individuals may travel across entire ocean basins from their feeding areas to nesting beaches in the tropics and sub-tropics. Like other marine turtles, female green turtles return to the same beach where they hatched to nest. The two largest remaining nesting areas (in terms of numbers of nesting females) for green turtles are the Caribbean coast of Central America and the Great Barrier Reef in Australia.</span> <span>Females will lay about 100 eggs per clutch and will nest several times over a few weeks. Once the eggs hatch, baby green turtles will make their way to the water and swim to offshore areas, where they will live for several years. Once juveniles reach a certain age and size range, they will leave the open ocean and travel to nearshore foraging grounds, where they shift to being primarily herbivores with a diet mainly consisting of seagrasses and algae. Both juvenile and adult green turtles are generally found nearshore, especially in areas with seagrass beds. Although green turtles generally only come to shore to nest, there is at least one population of green turtles (in Maui, Hawaii) that includes some individuals that are known to climb on beaches during the day, to rest in the sun.</span> <span>The primary threats facing green turtles are degradation and loss of nesting and foraging habitats, direct killing of turtles and harvest of eggs, vessel strikes, accidentally being captured as bycatch in commercial or recreational fishing gear, and entanglement in or ingestion of marine debris. Although many countries around the world offer green turtles some or complete legal protection, threats to their nesting beaches and direct killing of turtles for their meat and collection of eggs still persist.

    animalDescription: '<span class="highlighted-text">This species is able to survive so close to the equator because of the biogeography of the western coast of South America.  Cold, productive water travels from Antarctica via the Humboldt Current (named for the same explorer), which flows along this species’ entire distribution.  The Humboldt penguin is closely related to the other temperate penguins and more distantly related to the Antarctic penguins.</span> <span>Humboldt penguins breed year round and may raise more than one chick or clutch of chicks during a 12-month period.  They lay their eggs in burrows that they dig out of the thick layers of guano (sea bird droppings) that cover the coastline throughout their range.  While one parent feeds, the other parent guards the nest.  Incubation takes longer than one month.  Humboldt penguins form strong pair bonds and remain with the same partner for their entire lives.  They are foraging predators that primarily eat small fishes.  They forage relatively close their nests, as they are prey for the large marine predators of the area, namely sharks, fur seals, and sea lions.  Like all penguins, Humboldt penguins provide significant parental care for both the eggs and the chicks.</span> <span>Scientists consider the Humboldt penguin to be vulnerable to extinction.  Natural climate variation, human-induced changes to Earth’s climate system, and overfishing of their preferred prey species (e.g., Peruvian anchoveta) all contribute to this finding.  The cyclical, large-scale climate phenomenon known as El Niño significantly reduces the amount of food available to Humboldt penguins.  In severe cases, these events can lead to starvation of the adults.  While El Niño is a natural phenomenon, there is some growing evidence that human activities acting on the climate system as a whole may increase the severity or frequency of El Niño events.  Direct capture – for human consumption or for use as fish bait – and accidental capture in fishing gear targeting other species have also both been threats to this species, even though it is offered legal protection throughout its range.  Finally, historic (and ongoing) mining of guano for use in fertilizers and other products destroys Humboldt penguins’ burrows and alter their preferred breeding sites.  Continuing scientific research and conservation efforts are both vital to ensure that decreasing population trends are reversed.</span>',

Various carp species were originally domesticated in East Asia, where they were used as food fish. Carp are coldwater fish, and their ability to survive and adapt to many climates and water conditions allowed the domesticated species to be propagated to many new locations, including Japan. Natural color mutations of these carp would have occurred across all populations. Carp were first bred for color mutations in China more than a thousand years ago, where selective breeding of the Prussian carp (Carassius gibelio) led to the development of the goldfish.</span> <span>The hobby of keeping koi eventually spread worldwide. They are now sold in many pet aquarium shops, with higher-quality fish available from specialist dealers.[5][6] The collection of koi throughout the years has become quite the social hobby for many who have ponds. It is also common for hobbyists who are passionate about their koi to join a club specifically for their koi and ponds. Members tend to share their knowledge of the fish with others and even help each other out when they are in need of help with their koi.</span> <span>The length of a koi can average up to about 3.28 feet. On average they also grow about 2 centimeters per month. On the other hand, goldfish may only grow to be around a foot. In general, goldfish tend to be smaller than koi, and have a greater variety of body shapes and fin and tail configurations. Koi varieties tend to have a common body shape, but have a greater variety of coloration and color patterns. They also have prominent barbels on the lip. Some goldfish varieties, such as the common goldfish, comet goldfish, and shubunkin, have body shapes and coloration that are similar to koi, and can be difficult to tell apart from koi when immature.

Giant mantas are known to undergo long migrations and may visit colder waters for short periods of the year. Although giant mantas are typically solitary animals, they do aggregate to feed and mate. Giant manta rays have one of the lowest fecundity of all elasmobranchs, typically only giving birth to one pup every two to three years. Due to their broad range and sparse distribution across the world’s oceans, there are still gaps in scientists’ knowledge of giant manta ray’s life history.

Although conservation measures have been adapted in many places, demand for manta and other mobula rays’ gill rakers has increased dramatically in Asian markets. Fortunately, their interest to SCUBA divers and other tourism operations makes them more valuable alive than to fishers. This development may afford the giant manta more protection, but their value as meat and for traditional medicinal purposes continue to pose a risk to this species.

Nurse sharks are one of the species of sharks that are able to remain perfectly still, and they spend most of the daylight hours resting in caves or under ledges, sometimes in groups of several individuals.  During the twilight hours and at night, they become much more active and feed on fishes, rays, and invertebrates.

    animalDescription: '<span class="highlighted-text">The Pelagic thresher shark’s long tail, which can reach lengths of several meters, is used for hunting. Much like a swordfish’s or blue marlin’s bill, the tail is whipped side to side to stun or kill prey, making it particularly easy to capture. This behavior has only been observed a few times and filmed even fewer. Sport fishers, however, often catch this species by the tail. When an individual whips a fisher’s bait with its tail, it becomes hooked and is retrieved in reverse. Because pelagic thresher sharks need to swim forward to pass oxygenated water over their gills, they often die after being captured, even if they are released quickly. The pelagic thresher shark’s mouth is relatively small, and they eat small pelagic fishes and squids.</span> <span>Pelagic thresher sharks mate via internal fertilization and give live birth to only two very large pups. Though they give live birth, Pelagic Threshers do not connect to their young through a placenta. Instead, during the gestation period, the mother provides her young with unfertilized eggs that they actively eat for nourishment. Unlike the closely related common thresher shark, the pelagic thresher shark is unable to control its body temperature and is truly cold blooded (like almost all fishes).</span> <span>As a result of the pelagic thresher shark’s life history characteristics (very low reproductive rate, slow growth, etc.) and its capture by commercial shark fisheries and fisheries targeting other species, this shark is considered to be vulnerable to extinction. Populations around the world are declining, and scientists believe that unless negative trends are addressed soon, this species (and the other thresher sharks) may be in trouble. It is fished throughout its range and is afforded very little legal protection wherever it lives.</span>',

    animalDescription: '<span class="highlighted-text">The Redtail Catfish is a pimelodid (long-whiskered) catfish named for its red or orange caudal fin. The barbels along their snout are extremely sensitive and loaded with chemical reception cells, acting as another sense of smell for the fish. Due to their large size, the indigenous people in South America utilize these fish as a food source. They have been introduced into Florida, but have not established a sustainable population. It is a slow-moving, bottom-dwelling fish that is thought to attack prey by probing and ambush.</span> <span>A juvenile catfish can be very shy. Some suggestions to help them overcome their shyness include: providing cave areas for them to hide out in (make sure they’re not small enough to eat) and keeping the tank in an area where you spend plenty of time so they get use to interacting with you. Ideally you should house Redtail Catfish on their own. If you really want a tank mate, make sure that whatever you put in with it can’t fit into their mouth. They can easily eat anything that is half the size of them, and will even have a go at eating things that are larger than half their size – this can be fatal as they may choke.</span>',

    animalCategory: 'saltwater',
    scientificName: 'Pterois volitans',
    animalDescription: '<span class="highlighted-text">The red lionfish is an ambush predator.  It moves very slowly and often sits perfectly still, waiting for small fishes to approach too closely, at which point it lunges aggressively toward its prey.  At the same time, it extends its jaws forward, creating a large amount of suction, and easily swallowing the prey whole.  This species is not a picky eater and will eat just about any fish that it can swallow, limited only by the size of its mouth.  As it grows larger, the size of the prey that it can attack and eat also grows larger.  Some individuals have been observed slowly cornering prey with their large fins before attacking.  In its natural geographic range, the red lionfish is eaten by large bony fishes and coastal sharks.  In the western Atlantic, it has few (if any) natural predators.  In both basins, it uses its venom-filled spines in an attempt to guard against predation (not to attack prey).</span> <span>Male red lionfish are somewhat territorial and court females that enter the part of the reef that they defend.  After successful courtship, a male-female pair reproduces by a behavior known as broadcast spawning.  In this method, the female releases her eggs and the male releases his sperm in the water column, above the reef, at the same time.  This behavior increases the likelihood that eggs will become fertilized and decreases the likelihood that fertilized eggs will be eaten by egg predators at the reef surface.</span> <span>Red lionfish are eaten in some places but are not targeted heavily for human consumption.  In the past, they have been captured alive, in large numbers, for display in public and private aquaria.  They are naturally rare and have likely been depleted in some areas, but a more serious consequence of their live capture is the accidental establishment of large populations outside of their normal range.  In the 1990s, one or several individuals were released by pet owners in Florida, USA, and over the course of the past twenty years, the red lionfish has become a very common, destructive invasion throughout the western Atlantic Ocean.  Outside of its native range, there are few natural predators that can tolerate its venom.  It also eats a wider variety of prey and lives in colder latitudes in the western Atlantic.  It reaches densities up to ten times higher than in its natural range.  On some Caribbean reefs, it is now the most common medium-sized predator.  This invasion threatens coral reef food webs throughout the Caribbean Sea and other food webs in temperate areas.  Though some eradication efforts are underway for the red lionfish, we have likely passed a point of no return with respect to this species’ invasion of the Atlantic Ocean.  Scientists suspect that it will never be fully eliminated from that region and may, in fact, continue to increase its geographic range as a result of new invasions.</span>',

    scientificName: 'Sphyrna lewini',
    animalDescription: '<span class="highlighted-text">Like all hammerhead sharks, the scalloped hammerhead is an active predator and gains several advantages from the shape of its head. The widely spaced eyes, nostrils, and other senses allow the scalloped hammerhead to more successfully locate its prey near, or buried in, the sea floor. Also, the scalloped hammerhead may use its head to pin stingrays to the bottom, allowing them to successfully eat those difficult to capture species. Finally, like most sharks, the scalloped hammerhead has special sensory cells that it can use to detect the electric field given off by all other fishes. The wide head likely allows this species to more accurately utilize this sense, again helping it to locate prey buried in the sand.</span> <span>Historically, the scalloped hammerhead shark could be observed forming very large schools of hundreds (or more) adults, but this phenomenon makes the species vulnerable to targeted fishing, and many known grouping areas have been mostly depleted. Scientists are unsure why scalloped hammerheads form these occasional large groups, while maintaining solitary lifestyles for much of the time in between, but they seem to be social animals for at least part of the year. They mate via internal fertilization and give birth to live young, which spend several years living in coastal nursery habitat before moving to join the adult populations around deeper reefs, seamounts, and other open ecosystems.</span> <span>Though scalloped hammerheads have been implicated (but not confirmed) in biting some people, they are very shy and normally are quite successful at avoiding people. In fact, they can be difficult for scientists to study because they are so shy. Furthermore, they have small mouths relative to their large body size (up to 13 feet/4 m) and do not hunt prey larger than stingrays, so they are unlikely to show aggression toward people.</span> <span>Unfortunately, scalloped hammerheads have been overfished throughout much of their geographic distribution. Their fins are highly valuable, and their habit of forming regular, large groups makes it easy for fishers to take all of the individuals from a large area by fishing the right place at the right time. Conservation scientists have considered the scalloped hammerhead to be endangered with extinction for quite some time, and legal authorities have recently started to agree.  In July 2014, the United States listed several populations of the scalloped hammerhead as legally endangered, the first time that distinction has been extended to a shark species. With this protection and similar legal protection elsewhere in the international community, perhaps the scalloped hammerhead’s numbers can rebound and the large aggregations that have been lost in some places will return.</span>',

    animalDescription: '<span class="highlighted-text">Marine scientists have undertaken the difficult task of replacing the beloved starfish’s common name with sea star because, well, the starfish is not a fish. It’s an echinoderm, closely related to sea urchins and sand dollars. There are some 2,000 species of sea star living in all the world’s oceans, from tropical habitats to the cold seafloor. The five-arm varieties are the most common, hence their name, but species with 10, 20, and even 40 arms exist.</span> <span>They have bony, calcified skin, which protects them from most predators, and many wear striking colors that camouflage them or scare off potential attackers. Purely marine animals, there are no freshwater sea stars, and only a few live in brackish water. Beyond their distinctive shape, sea stars are famous for their ability to regenerate limbs, and in some cases, entire bodies. They accomplish this by housing most or all of their vital organs in their arms. Some require the central body to be intact to regenerate, but a few species can grow an entirely new sea star just from a portion of a severed limb.</span> <span>Most sea stars also have the remarkable ability to consume prey outside their bodies. Using tiny, suction-cupped tube feet, they pry open clams or oysters, and their sack-like cardiac stomach emerges from their mouth and oozes inside the shell. The stomach then envelops the prey to digest it, and finally withdraws back into the body.</span>',

    animalDescription: '<span class="highlighted-text">Their incredible size may help them to survive long migrations to abundant food sources, between which they may not be able to find enough food. Scientists believe that some individuals swim across entire oceans to arrive just in time for a plankton bloom or a mass spawning of fish or coral eggs – an amazing feat for a fish.</span> <span>As opposed to the other large sharks, which give birth to a small number of very large babies, whale sharks give birth to hundreds of very small babies (approximately 20 inches/45 cm). Even more interesting, after internal fertilization, the female whale shark actually produces hard, reinforced egg cases but then keeps them safely inside her abdomen until they hatch, at which point she gives live birth. The energy required to produce the unnecessary egg cases could perhaps be better utilized to produce more young, though it is possible that under some circumstances, the female deposits her eggs to hatch on their own.</span> <span>Whale sharks are also unique in that they are covered with white spots, and every individual apparently has its own spot pattern. In fact, whale shark researchers utilize specialized computer software, originally designed for star mapping, to identify individual whale sharks from photos of their spot patterns. Using this technology, researchers will be able to tell if individuals that are photographed by tourists in Mexico are later photographed by fishermen in Belize, for example.</span> <span>Like many large, slow moving animals, the whale shark has been fished quite heavily over the last several decades, and individuals are often accidentally caught in fishing gear that targets other species. Whale shark meat is eaten in some parts of the world, and the fins are valuable as well. Scientists currently believe whale sharks to be vulnerable to extinction. Fortunately, a large tourism industry has been developed for viewing whale sharks in the wild, and their value alive is higher than their value to fishers. For that reason and because they are such impressive animals, most places around the world offer whale sharks complete legal protection. Unfortunately, illegal fishing does still occur in some places.</span>',

    animalDescription: '<span class="highlighted-text">Zebra sharks are nocturnal foragers, hunting for small fish, snails, sea urchins, crabs and other small invertebrates that hide out in crevices. Even though they may not look as ferocious as their toothy relatives, the zebra shark’s body is perfectly adapted for snatching up prey. Barbels, or whisker-like organs at the front of their snouts, help them seek out prey, while a flexible body allows them to wriggle in tight spaces where small fishes are often hiding. They also have small mouths and strong gill muscles to easily suck up prey in one gulp. During daylight, the zebra shark prefers to rest on the ocean floor facing the current so they can efficiently pump water over their gills and breathe while remaining still. If the current is strong enough, this slow-moving shark species has been observed “surfing,” adjusting its fins to remain motionless in open water.</span> <span>During reproduction, male zebra sharks transfer sperm to the female using claspers, or modifications of the pelvic fins, and the female can lay up to four eggs at a time. The egg cases are covered in fine fibers that keep them anchored to the sea floor for about six and a half months while developing. A zebra shark pup may be less than a foot long at birth, but an adult can grow to be almost 12 feet and have a tail that reaches half its full body length. Adult zebra sharks are non-aggressive, and have few predators other than larger shark species that may be lucky enough to catch one in its jaws.</span> <span>As with other sharks, the largest threat to zebra sharks is humans. The zebra shark is taken by a wide range of inshore fisheries and prized for its meat, which may be sold fresh or salt-dried in markets throughout Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia, Philippines, and elsewhere. Its liver is also processed for vitamins and its fins are chopped off for use in shark fin soup that remains a traditional Chinese delicacy. Although the practice of shark finning is illegal in U.S. waters, fins can still be bought and sold from unsustainable foreign fisheries, which are lacking or have ineffective shark finning bans. The combination of these practices is driving down zebra shark populations in most of their range, and they are considered endangered by the IUCN Red List. However, in Australia, the species is considered of Least Concern because it has a wide distribution and is not heavily fished.</span>',
